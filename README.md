# OpenCV Tutorials
A collection of OpenCV assignments for a McGill University Computer Vision Course (ECSE 415).

## Low Level Vision - Edge Detection and Sharpness Enhancement
Under `Assignment_1`, the goal was to perform computer vision filters on images to identify and enchance edges, and reduce blurring.

## Mid Level Vision - Panorama Stitching
Under `Assignment_2`, the goal was to stitch images together to create a panorama.

## Mid Level Vision - Depth Maps and Unsupervised Color Clustering
Under `Assignment_3`, the goals were to generate depth maps, generate epipolar lines, and implement KMeans clustering from scratch to cluster colors in an image.

## High Level Vision - Face Detection and Recognition
Under `Assignment_4`, the goal was to identify and recognize faces within a group photo image with the use of principal component analysis and eigenfaces.
